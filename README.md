# PythonProgrammingTask2

## Task 1 - Edinburgh cycle hire data
The first task is to investigate the dataset in the file `bikes_October18.csv` which contains anonymised data for all trips taken in October 2018 with the Edinburgh Cycle Hire bikes (found [here](https://edinburghcyclehire.com/open-data/historical)). This dataset is kindly supplied for use by Edinburgh Cycle Hire under the [Open Government License (OGL) v3.0](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/).

- What is the average journey time and distance of bike trips which started on a Tuesday?
- How many stations appear in the dataset? Which were the most common starting stations? Think about how to display/plot the results of your analysis.
- What was the most common time(s) of day for journeys to be undertaken?
- Can you process the geographic information (latitudes and longitudes of start and end stations), and display this in an interesting way?
- Can you use the data to answer any other interesting questions about the bike trips?

Please include all the code used to generate your answer and plots, and remember to investigate beyond the initial scope of the questions.

Visual Results


The above plot gives us an estimate about how much time do the people in Edinburgh spend on cycling depending on the day. The median duration during weekends seems to be higher than the other days at about 25 mins, which is reasonable. Moreover, during Saturday and Sunday 25% of the journeys take over 50 minutes and we see that maximum reaches 100 mins for Sunday and about 80 min for Saturday.
